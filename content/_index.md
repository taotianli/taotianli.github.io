        My research interests lie in the intersection of high-performance algorithms and their application in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease analysis using multimodal data. During my graduate study, I am the core student member of the Chinese Baby Connectome Project (CBCP), where I gained in-depth knowledge in infant data collection and sMRI & rs-fMRI data analysis. Over the past year, I have been engaged in several significant projects published in IEEE EMBC, ISBI, OHBM, ISMRM and MICCAI workshop, where I have served as the primary author.
